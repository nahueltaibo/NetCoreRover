The idea of this project is to create a Rover based on .net core, with a raspberry pi brain, and Who knows what other hardware..

We'll see how far I get..

Check [the Wiki](https://github.com/nahueltaibo/netcorerover/wiki) for required hardware and steps on how to configure the environment to program this robot.
